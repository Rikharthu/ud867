/* In this series of exercises you'll explore Gradle's incremental build
support. You'll be using the same source files used in the last set of
exercises. After each exercise, take note of the Gradle build output. Remember,
tasks that are marked UP-TO-DATE are skipped by Gradle because it has been
determined that no work needed to be done.

Exercises:

1. Run the "copySources" task, which copies files from "src" to "build/out".
2. Run the "copySources" task again and note it is now UP-TO-DATE.
3. Modify the contents of one of the files in the "src" directory.
4. Run the "copySources" task again and note it is no longer UP-TO-DATE.
5. Delete the "build" directory.
6. Run the "copySources" task again and note it is no longer UP-TO-DATE.
7. Run the "bundleSources" task. Note that the "copySources" task is
still UP-TO-DATE.
8. Run the "bundleSources" task again and note it is now UP-TO-DATE.
9. Delete the "build/sources.zip" file.
10. Run the "bundleSources" task and note it is no longer UP-TO-DATE.
11. Modify the contents of one of the files in the "src" directory.
12. Run the "bundleSources" task and note neither task is UP-TO-DATE.
13. Run the "bundleSources" task again and note both tasks are now UP-TO-DATE.
14. Delete the "build/out" directory.
15. Run the "bundleSources" task again and note that only the "bundleSources"
task is marked as UP-TO-DATE.
